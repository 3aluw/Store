add recursive function to this in case of total > limit (100). increase to page 2 - 3... 
deskree.orders.getOrdersByDateRange
deskree.users.getUsersByDateRange

task 2
in case of all orders in the past week had been retrieved handle them locally to generate a chart in stats component instead of relying on deskree
How ? make useTimer().getPastWeekDays generate a date without time (8/27/2023) using the function : new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US').format(//pass date)
then use the same function with the orders object(createdAt attribute) then check for equality to create an object of days with the number of orders
OR 
Use the retrieved data in the monthly metrics to generate the charts and change the title of the charts to : the distribution of latest orders - users 

TASK 3
add orders_number and total_spent columns to users table on deskree and modify it on every order delivered on admin>orders>editUserOrders function passing to it currentOrder.value.author as user uid
